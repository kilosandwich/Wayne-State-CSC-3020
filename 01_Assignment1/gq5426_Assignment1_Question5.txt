/******************************************************************************

5.	(6 points) Write a program that prompts the user to enter the 
center coordinates and radii of two circles and determines whether
the second circle is inside the first or overlaps with the first,
as shown in the below figure.

This is where my figure would go, IF I HAD ONE!!!!

Hint: 
circle2 is inside circle1 if the distance between the two centers < = r1 - r2 
circle2 overlaps circle1 if the distance between the two centers  <= r1 + r2. 

Test your program to cover all cases.

Here are sample runs:
Enter circle1’s center x-, y-coordinates, and radius: 0.5 5.1 13
Enter circle2’s center x-, y-coordinates, and radius: 1 1.7 4.5
circle2 is inside circle1
Enter circle1’s center x-, y-coordinates, and radius: 3.4 5.7 5.5
Enter circle2’s center x-, y-coordinates, and radius: 6.7 3.5 3
circle2 overlaps circle1

Enter circle1’s center x-, y-coordinates, and radius: 3.4 5.5 1
Enter circle2’s center x-, y-coordinates, and radius: 5.5 7.2 1
circle2 does not overlap circle1
