/******************************************************************************

Twenty students were asked to rate on a scale of 1 to 5 the quality of the food in the student cafeteria, with 1 being “awful” and 5 being “excellent.” The 20 responses are stored in “numbers.txt” file. Read the responses from “numbers.txt” file, determine the frequency of each rating and output it to the text file “output.txt”. 
The responses should be read from the file by using a Scanner. Use method nextInt to input one integer at a time from the file. The program should continue to read responses until it reaches the end of the file. The results should be output to the text file “output.txt”. Use a PrintWriter to create a file called “output.txt”. Each integer should be written using method printf. 
Use FileNotFoundException and NoSuchElementException Exceptions.
Sample input and output are shown in the below table.
